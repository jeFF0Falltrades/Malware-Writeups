# Malware-Writeups
This repo houses a collection of my public reverse engineering and malware analysis write-ups.

I will never claim to be an expert reverse engineer, but I am always willing to share all that I can (that's not under NDA).

I am always looking for feedback, corrections, tips, and lessons learned.

The easiest way to get the above to me is [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeFF0Falltrades).

## Write-Ups Included
* Qrypter Java RAT
    * One of the first Java RATs I ever analyzed, originally [published in March 2018](https://twitter.com/jeFF0Falltrades/status/977210067542999041)
* Qealler Java RAT
    * Another Java RAT with the added twist of dropping QaZagne: A Python credential stealer based on [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne), first [published in September 2018](https://twitter.com/jeFF0Falltrades/status/1044587332790214656)
    * Includes *FileInterceptor.java*, a custom Java class which aides in capturing reflected classes from Qealler during analysis
